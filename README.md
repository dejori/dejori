## About Me
Hi I'm Mathäus (pronounced mah-TAY-oos) and I am currently leading a team of Data Scientists and ML Engineers building products that help healthcare professionals provide better care. 

My time is spend between managing people, making sure they get everything they need to succeed in their goals, coading and reading papers. The last paper I read was <!-- MENDELEY-LIST:START -->
<!-- MENDELEY-LIST:END -->
