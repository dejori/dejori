## About Me
Hi, I'm Mathäus (pronounced mah-TAY-oos) and I am currently leading a team of data scientists and machine learning engineers building products that empower doctors, nurses and other healthcare professionals to provide better care. 

At work I balance my time between strategic planning, making sure everyone on my team has what they need to succeed in their goals, and hands-on engineering. Working in machine learning means continuous human learning. It's sometimes a curse, because everything is constantly changing underneath you, but more so a gift, because it's an exciting time to be in this field.

Outside of work, I love reading, people watching and escaping the city for the outdoors.
